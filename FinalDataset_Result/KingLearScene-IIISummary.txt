In Scene III of King Lear, Goneril, one of Lear's daughters, speaks with her steward Oswald about her father's behavior. She complains about how he causes trouble and argues with her and her knights, and plans to confront him when he returns from hunting. Goneril also reveals her plan to send a letter to her sister, Regan, to inform her of the situation. She instructs Oswald to act indifferent towards Lear and his knights and to let them know that she will not tolerate their behavior.
