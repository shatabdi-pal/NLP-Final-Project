My dear Mr. Bennet, said his lady to him one day, have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last? Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. Bennet made no answer. Do you not want to know who has taken it? cried his wife impatiently. Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. What a fine thing for our girls! How so? How can it affect them? My dear Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party. My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty. In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of. But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood. It is more than I engage for, I assure you. But consider your daughters. You mistake me, my dear. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least. Ah, you do not know what I suffer. Â«But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood. It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them. Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all. Mr.Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.

She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper.
