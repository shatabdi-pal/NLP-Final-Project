The opening sentence of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife," sets the stage for the rest of the passage. Mrs. Bennet tells her husband that a wealthy young man named Mr. Bingley has rented Netherfield Park, which excites her because she hopes that one of her daughters will marry him. Mr. Bennet is skeptical but eventually agrees to visit Mr. Bingley. The passage also reveals the characters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet: Mr. Bennet is sarcastic and reserved while Mrs. Bennet is focused on getting her daughters married and easily irritated.
